## Application State with Redux

![](./download.png)

* Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.

* It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as live code editing combined with a time-traveling debugger.

* You can use Redux together with React, or with any other view library. It is tiny (2kB, including dependencies), but has a large ecosystem of addons available.

## Redux Toolkit

 > is our official recommended approach for writing Redux logic. It wraps around the Redux core, and contains packages and functions that we think are essential for building a Redux app. Redux Toolkit builds in our suggested best practices, simplifies most Redux tasks, prevents common mistakes, and makes it easier to write Redux applications.

### Installation

* Redux Toolkit

 ```
 npm install @reduxjs/toolkit
 ```

* Create a React Redux App

```
# Redux + Plain JS template
npx create-react-app my-app --template redux

# Redux + TypeScript template
npx create-react-app my-app --template redux-typescript
```

* Redux Core

```

npm install redux

```
