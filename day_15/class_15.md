## AWS Lambda Basics

> AWS Lambda is a way to run code without creating, managing, or paying for servers. You supply AWS with the code required to run your function.

* AWS will scale your code for you, depending on the number of requests it receives. Not having to build and pay for servers is nice.

## AWS Lambda Functions

* AWS Lambda is a serverless, event-driven compute service that lets you run code for virtually any type of application or backend service without provisioning or managing servers. You can trigger Lambda from over 200 AWS services and software as a service (SaaS) applications and only pay for what you use.
